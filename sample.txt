tttttttttt
the mountains,
Painting the sky with hues of orange and gold.
A gentle breeze whispers through the trees,
Carrying with it the scent of blooming flowers.
In the meadow, a stream dances along,
Its clear waters glistening in the fading light.
Birds return to their nests as day turns to night,
Their songs creating a soothing lullaby.
Stars begin to twinkle in the vast expanse above,
Each one a distant reminder of the universe's beauty.
As the world grows quiet, the night comes alive,
With secrets and dreams that only darkness knows.
I find solace in the tranquil embrace of the night,
A moment of peace before the new day arrives.
Nature's symphony continues in the stillness,
And I am but a small part of its timeless melody.
